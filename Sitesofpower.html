        <p>This city lies near modern-day Al-Fayyum. Although originally named Shedet, the city was renamed Crocodilopolis by the Greeks.<br>
        It was the principal site of Sobek's worship. Ancient Egyptians supposedly worshipped a crocodile here, commonly known as 'Son of Sobek'.<br>
        Whenever the crocodile died, it was mummified and a new 'Son of Sobek' was found.</p>
        <h1>Nubt</h1>
        <p>Once known as Nubt, now known as Naqada, this city housed a temple to Sobek. More well known by its Greek name,<br>
        the Temple of Kom Ombo. Half of the temple was also dedicated to Horus, another god Sobek was closely linked to.<br>
        Live crocodiles were supposedly housed inside the temple at times.</p>
