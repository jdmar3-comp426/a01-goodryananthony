    <p>Sobek is an ancient Egyptian god. He was largely revered during the Old Kingdom period in Egyptian history, but persisted long after. The Egyptians perceived Sobek in a strange light because for them, he represented both the terrifying power of crocodiles, which are abundant on the edges of the nile, and the life-giving nature of the Nile itself. For these reasons, he's known as 'The Rager', 'The God of the Nile', and 'Lord of the Waters'.  </p>
