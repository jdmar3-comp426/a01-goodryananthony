        <p>Sobek is an ancient Egyptian god. He was largely revered during the Old Kingdom period in Egyptian history, but persisted long after. <br>
            The Egyptians perceived Sobek in a strange light because for them, he represented both the terrifying power of crocodiles,<br>
            which are abundant on the edges of the nile, and the life-giving nature of the Nile itself. For these reasons, he's known as 'The Rager',<br>
            'The God of the Nile', and 'Lord of the Waters'.  </p>
